# capstoneBackendGO

This is the Golang implementation of the [CountryCheck Backend](https://github.com/luschnat-ziegler/capstone-project/tree/main/backend) (originally written in PHP/Symfony). 
It uses mongodb instead of SQL and proper JWT authentication.

This project is purely for learning and experimentation purposes.

It is not yet fully compatible with the React Front-End.

### To Do:

- More stringent error handling
- Refactoring (lots of duplicate code)
- Logging
- Unit testing
